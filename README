This is simple example on how to use tasks and protected objects in Ada to
solve the problem of counting 20 times to 1_000_000_000.

The Sequential program solves it sequentially while the Concurrent solves it by
starting a bunch of concurrent workers.

To compile and execute:

   $ cd sequential
   $ gnatmake sequential.adb
   $ time sequential

Substitute "sequential" with "concurrent" in the above to try the concurrent
program.
